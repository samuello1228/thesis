  <abstract>Quality criteria for the selection of reconstructed anti-$k_t$ jets with $R = 0.4$ in the ATLAS detector are described. The study is based on data recorded in June 2015 by the ATLAS experiment in $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV protonâproton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider, with a total integrated luminosity of 6.4 pb$^{−1}$. Two selection criteria are introduced. The Loose selection is designed to provide an efficiency of selecting jets from proton-proton collisions above 99.5% (99.9%) for $p_T&gt;$ 20 (100) GeV to be used in most ATLAS physics analyses. A tighter set of selection cuts, called Tight, is designed to further reject background jets for analyses sensitive to non-collision backgrounds with an efficiency of selecting jets from proton-proton collisions above 95% (99.5%) for $p_T&gt;$ 20 (100) GeV.</abstract>
