No any significant excess in signal is observed in the signal regions.
Hence, the upper limits of the SUSY signal contribution are set and exclusion limits on the masses of $m_{\tilde{\chi}_1^\pm, \tilde{\chi}_2^0}$ and $m_{\tilde{\chi}_1^0}$ are also set at the 95\% confidence level, in a simplified supersymmetric model.

The observed events in data and the estimated background yields in the two signal regions are shown in table \ref{tab:result_SR_result}.
The N-1 plots (i.e. all SR selections, but the variable on the x-axis, are applied) for the two signal regions are shown in figures \ref{fig:result_Nminus1_1} and \ref{fig:result_Nminus1_2}.
The observed data and the Standard Model expectations are agree with each other for all distributions within the uncertainties.
No any significant excess in signal is observed.

Table \ref{tab:result_upper_limit} shows the results of the model-independent fit.
This estimates the upper limits on the contributions from new physics, i.e. physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM).
The second and third column show the upper limits on the observed ($S_{\rm obs}^{95}$) and expected ($S_{\rm exp}^{95}$) BSM events respectively, at 95\% confidence level.
The fluctuations of the upper limits of $S_{\rm exp}^{95}$ are also shown, with $\pm 1\sigma$ excursions on the expectation of the background events.
The numbers in the first column are the upper limits on the observed visible cross-section $\sigma_{\text{vis}}$ at 95\% confidence level.
With the normalization by the integrated luminosity of the data, the upper limit on the observed BSM events can be converted to an upper limit on an observed visible cross-section.
The definition of the observed visible cross-section $\sigma_{\text{vis}}$ is the product of a BSM cross-section, the acceptance and the selection efficiency of a BSM signal.
The last column shows the discovery $p$-value ($p_0$).
It is the probability that the Standard Model background by itself fluctuate to the observed number of events or higher.

The third column ($S_{\rm exp}^{95}$) shows the 95\% confidence level upper limit on the expected number of signal events,
with $\pm 1\sigma$ excursions on the expectation of the background events.
%The last two columns indicate the $CL_B$ value, i.e. the confidence level observed for the background-only hypothesis.

Figure \ref{fig:result_exclusion_limit} shows the expected and observed exclusion limits on the masses of $m_{\tilde{\chi}_1^\pm, \tilde{\chi}_2^0}$ and $m_{\tilde{\chi}_1^0}$ at the 95\% confidence level.
The exclusion limits means that the mass points inside the curve are excluded, but the mass points outside the curve are still possible.
The exclusion limits are calculated by combining the two signal regions.
Compared with other channels in Wh search, our same-sign channel is sensitive in the low $m_{\tilde{\chi}_1^\pm, \tilde{\chi}_2^0}$ region and the compressed region described in section \ref{sec:Wh_signal}.
The exclusion limits for the masses of $\tilde{\chi}_1^\pm$ and $\tilde{\chi}_2^0$ are extended up to 245 GeV, while the exclusion limits for the mass of $\tilde{\chi}_1^0$ are extended up to 40 GeV.

\caption{The expected and observed exclusion limits for the combined SRjet1 and SRjet23 are shown. Experimental and theoretical systematic uncertainties are applied to background and signal samples and illustrated by the yellow band and the red dotted contour lines respectively. The red dotted lines indicate the $\pm 1 \sigma$ variation on the observed exclusion limit due to theoretical uncertainties on the signal cross-section.}

Results of a search for the electroweak pair production of a chargino and a neutralino
($p + p \rightarrow \tilde{\chi}_1^\pm + \tilde{\chi}_2^0$) are presented, with the Wh channel $\tilde{\chi}_1^\pm \rightarrow \tilde{\chi}_1^0 + W$ and $\tilde{\chi}_2^0 \rightarrow \tilde{\chi}_1^0 + h$, and the same-sign channel.
The dominant background is the fake lepton background, and the dominant irreducible background is the diboson processes, especially the WZ processes.
Two signal regions are defined and optimized for the compressed region where the mass difference between $\tilde{\chi}_1^\pm$/$\tilde{\chi}_2^0$ and $\tilde{\chi}_1^0$ is close to the Higgs mass 125 GeV.
No significant deviations due to the signal are observed, but new exclusion limits for the masses $m_{\tilde{\chi}_1^\pm, \tilde{\chi}_2^0}$ and $m_{\tilde{\chi}_1^0}$ are set.
The exclusion limits for the masses of $\tilde{\chi}_1^\pm$ and $\tilde{\chi}_2^0$ are extended up to 245 GeV, while the exclusion limits for the mass of $\tilde{\chi}_1^0$ are extended up to 40 GeV.
