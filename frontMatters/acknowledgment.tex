\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

I would like to take this opportunity to thank some people who helped me do the research.

I would like to thank my supervisor Dr. Tu Yanjun for giving me the opportunity to do the research, for her support on my research and for her guidance and suggestions on my analysis.

I would like to thank Dr. Zhang Dongliang.
He taught me almost everything on the analysis.
He help me get familiar with the linux software: the linux shell, the text editor (vim) and the revision control system (svn).
He taught me how to use the ATLAS software: the event analysis software (ROOT and RootCore), the data acquisition software(dq2 and rucio) and the distributed computing management (grid and panda).
I learnt the typesetting system (latex) from him.
He taught me the ALTAS detector: trigger system and GRL.
He also helped our group write the multiLepSearch package to generate the ntuple.

I would like to thank Dr. Daniela Paredes.
She gave a lot of suggestions on my analysis.
She also helped our group to do analysis.
